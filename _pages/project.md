Your class project offers an opportunity to apply probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and modern probabilistic AI techniques to real-world problems. Projects will be completed in **teams of 2-4 students** and are worth **30% of your final grade**, consisting of the following deliverables:

1. **Proposal** (5%): 2 pages, excluding references.
2. **Midway Report** (5%): 4 pages, excluding references.
3. **Presentation** (5%): In-class presentation.
4. **Final Report** (15%): 8 pages, excluding references.

All submissions must adhere to the [ICML style template](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/ICML2019/Styles/icml2019_style.zip).

## Team Formation

Teams of 2-4 students are strongly encouraged. Once your team is formed, email the instructor with the names of all members. If assistance is needed, contact the instructor to help find project partners.

## Deliverables and Deadlines

### **Proposal**
**Due:** Friday, March 7, 2025, at 11:59 PM via Canvas.

- **Content**:
  - Project title and team member list.
  - Problem statement and motivation (½ page).
  - Literature review of at least four relevant papers (~1 page).
  - Description of dataset(s) and planned activities.

- **Grading**:
  - 40%: Clear and concise description of the project.
  - 40%: Quality of literature survey.
  - 10%: Feasibility and detail of activity plan.
  - 10%: Writing quality.

### **Midway Report**
**Due:** Friday, April 11, 2025, at 11:59 PM via Canvas.

- **Purpose**:
This report ensures you’ve made **real progress** on your project. By now, you should have:  
  - Implemented an initial version of your model or experiments.  
  - Run at least some tests—even if they didn’t work.  
  - Identified challenges and next steps.
This is not just a plan—it must reflect **actual work done** so far.  

- **Format & Length**:
  - **4 full pages**, excluding references. May **slightly spill onto a fifth page**, but be concise.  
  - Use the **ICML template** (single-column format).  
  - References must be on a separate page.  
  - **Figures & Tables**
    - Use **`figure`** for single-column figures, **`figure*`** for full-width figures. Figure sizes (including using **`\width=`** commands) will significantly change your report length, so size them properly.
    - Ensure figures are **numbered, referenced, and captioned** properly.  
  - **Required Sections** (length of each sections will vary by project focus)
    - **Abstract (~150-200 words)**
      - Summary of the problem, approach, progress, key challenges, and next steps.  
    - **Introduction (½ - 1 page)**
      - Problem statement and motivation.  
      - Role of **probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) or probabilistic AI**.
    - **Related Work (~½ page)**
      - Summary of at least **four relevant papers** and how they relate to your work.  
    - **Methods (~1 page)**
      - Implemented work so far (not just plans).  
      - Model structure, key assumptions, modifications.  
      - Challenges encountered and adjustments made.  
    - **Experiments (~1 page)**
      - Dataset(s) and experimental setup.  
      - Preliminary results, even if unsuccessful.  
    - **Conclusion & Updated Plan (~½ page)**
      - Summary of progress, challenges, and next steps.  
      - Timeline for final report.  

- **Grading**
  - **20%: Abstract, Introduction & Related Work** (Clarity, relevance, citations)  
  - **30%: Methods & Implementation** (Actual work done, challenges, technical clarity)  
  - **30%: Experiments & Preliminary Results** (Progress, results, adjustments)  
  - **10%: Next Steps & Timeline** (Realistic plan, addressing issues)
  - **10%: Writing & Organization** (Clarity, structure, proper citations & figures)  

---

### **Final Report**
**Due:** Monday, May 5, 2025, at 11:59 PM via Canvas.

- **Content**:
  - ICML-style paper (8 pages).
  - Sections: Introduction, Background & Related Work, Methods, Experiments, and Conclusions.

- **Grading**:
  - 10%: Problem definition and literature review.
  - 30%: Methodology (soundness and originality).
  - 30%: Experiments and results.
  - 10%: Analysis and discussion.
  - 20%: Writing quality.

---

### **In-Class Presentation**
**Date:** Tuesday and Thursday, April 29 and May 1, 2025.

- **Format**: Each team will deliver a **8-minute presentation** in class, summarizing their project. Presentations will include a brief introduction, methods overview, key findings, and future directions.

- **Grading**:
  - 30%: Clarity and engagement of presentation.
  - 40%: Depth and quality of content.
  - 30%: Use of visuals and adherence to time limits.
