## Grading

The class requirements and grading breakdown are as follows:

- Homework Assignments (40%)
- Quiz (10%)
- Midterm Exam (20%)
- Final Project (30%)

**Extra Credit:** Students can earn up to 3% extra credit for writing high-quality lecture notes.


### Homework Assignments

There will be regular homework assignments to reinforce core concepts and computational skills. These assignments will include both theoretical problems and programming exercises.

#### Policies:
- **Submission:** Assignments must be submitted via Canvas by 11:59 PM on Fridays unless otherwise noted.
- **Collaboration:** Students may discuss problems, but all submitted work must be individual. Proper citations are required. AI tools are allowed, but the answers must reflect your understanding.
- **Late Policy:** Late submissions incur a penalty of 10% per day for up to three days. Submissions more than three days late will not be accepted unless prior arrangements are made.

### Quiz and Midterm Exam

- **Quiz:** A single in-class quiz during Week 4 (February 13, 2025) will cover topics such as conditional independence, Bayesian networks, and Markov networks.
- **Midterm Exam:** The in-class, closed-book midterm exam during Week 9 (March 20, 2025) will cover foundational topics like Bayesian networks, Markov networks, exact inference algorithms, and basic parameter learning methods.

***

### Final Project

The final project will be completed in groups of up to three students. It will include:
- **Proposal (5%)**: Due March 7, 2025.
- **Midway Report (5%)**: Due April 11, 2025.
- **Presentation (5%)**: During the final week of class.
- **Final Report (15%)**: Due May 5, 2025.

Projects may explore probabilistic graphical models applied to real-world problems or modern probabilistic AI topics.
