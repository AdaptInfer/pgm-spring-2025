## About Research Papers

While research papers may appear rigorous and comprehensive, they often omit practical nuances. As learners, we should approach them optimistically — extracting value even from imperfect sources.

## From Biological to Artificial Neurons

Early AI models were inspired by biological neurons. The **McCulloch & Pitts** neuron, proposed in 1943, used threshold logic to compute simple Boolean functions like AND and OR. However, it **could not represent XOR**.

## The Perceptron and Its Limits

<figure id="perceptron" class="l-body-outset">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col three">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/notes/lecture-15/perceptron.png'| relative_url }}" 
         style="width:80%; max-width:800px;" />
  </div>
</div>
</figure>
The perceptron extended MP neurons by introducing **weighted inputs** and **activation functions** (like sigmoid):

<d-math block>
f(x) = \sigma(w^\top x + b)
</d-math>



This model supports gradient-based learning for functions like:

<d-math block>
Y \sim \mathcal{N}(f(x), \Sigma) \Rightarrow \arg\min_w \sum_i \left(y_i - f(x_i; w)\right)^2
<d-math>

### Why XOR Cannot Be Represented

Suppose XOR could be represented by a single-layer perceptron. Then:

<d-math block>
- \( \sigma(w_1 + w_2) < \theta \) for input (1,1)
- \( \sigma(w_1) \geq \theta \), \( \sigma(w_2) \geq \theta \) for inputs (1,0), (0,1)
<d-math>

Adding the latter two contradicts the first — **no linear decision boundary exists**.

---

## Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)

<figure id="MLP" class="l-body-outset">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col three">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/notes/lecture-15/NN.png'| relative_url }}" 
         style="width:75%; max-width:800px;" />
  </div>
</div>
</figure>


To model non-linear functions like XOR, **multi-layer perceptrons** are introduced:

- **Input Layer** \( x \)
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: 

<d-math block>
\( h = \sigma(Wx + b) \)
<d-math>

- **Output Layer**: 

<d-math block>
\( \hat{y} = W' h + b' \)
<d-math>

This architecture allows **hierarchical feature extraction** and can represent any continuous function under mild assumptions.

---

## Backpropagation

Neural networks are compositions of differentiable functions:

<d-math block>
L = \ell(f_3(f_2(f_1(x))))
<d-math>


The gradient is computed via **reverse-mode autodiff**:

<d-math block>
\frac{dL}{dx} = \frac{dL}{df_3} \cdot \frac{df_3}{df_2} \cdot \frac{df_2}{df_1} \cdot \frac{df_1}{dx}
<d-math>

This process is the core of **backpropagation**, enabling scalable training of deep networks.

## Graphical Models vs. Deep Nets

| Graphical Models (GMs)        | Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Probabilistic semantics       | Function approximation        |
| Explicit latent variables     | Learned intermediate features |
| Inference via message passing | Learning via SGD              |

While GMs offer **interpretability**, DNNs provide **flexibility and scalability**. Hybrid models aim to combine both strengths.

---

## Probabilistic Neural Nets

### Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

<figure id="RBM" class="l-body-outset">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col three">
      <img src="{{ 'assets/img/notes/lecture-15/RBM.png' | relative_url }}" 
           style="width:60%; max-width:800px;" />
    </div>
  </div>
  </figure>



An RBM is an undirected graphical model with visible \( v \) and hidden \( h \) units:

<d-math block>
P(v, h) \propto e^{-E(v, h)}, \quad E(v, h) = -v^\top W h - a^\top v - b^\top h
<d-math>


RBMs are trained using **contrastive divergence**, and serve as building blocks for deeper models.

---

### Deep Belief Networks (DBN)

<figure id="DBN" class="l-body-outset">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col one">
      <img src="{{ 'assets/img/notes/lecture-15/DBN.png' | relative_url }}" />
    </div>
    <div class="col one">
      <img src="{{ 'assets/img/notes/lecture-15/pretraining.png' | relative_url }}" />
    </div>
  </div>
</figure>

DBNs stack multiple RBMs and apply **layer-wise pretraining**, followed by supervised fine-tuning. They offer a probabilistic view of deep learning, with each layer capturing increasingly abstract representations.

## NNs and GMs—Natural Complements

Neural networks and graphical models represent two major paradigms in probabilistic AI. While they originate from different modeling philosophies, they can be viewed as **complementary** in both function and design.

Graphical models (GMs) offer **structured representations** of joint distributions, with explicit semantics over variables and their dependencies. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) are powerful **function approximators**, trained end-to-end via gradient-based optimization. Despite this apparent contrast, many modern systems integrate the two:

- **GMs for interpretability, NNs for flexibility**: GMs allow for explicit latent structure and reasoning under uncertainty, while NNs can model complex, high-dimensional mappings without handcrafted features.

- **Neural modules within probabilistic models**: In structured prediction, NNs can be used to parameterize potentials in conditional random fields (CRFs), or emission probabilities in HMMs.

- **Probabilistic perspectives on NNs**: Some architectures (e.g., RBMs, DBNs) are inherently graphical models, and even standard feedforward networks can be viewed as approximate inference in layered latent variable models.

- **Uncertainty estimation in NNs**: Probabilistic modeling techniques such as variational inference or Bayesian dropout can be used to **quantify uncertainty** in neural predictions, a critical aspect in safety-sensitive domains.

Specific examples include:

- <d-cite key="graves2013speech"></d-cite>: combined recurrent neural networks with probabilistic decoding in speech recognition, using RNNs for acoustic modeling and probabilistic search for decoding.

- <d-cite key="collobert2011natural"></d-cite>: applied deep networks to NLP tasks, where word embeddings are learned by a neural network, and structured output is modeled using CRFs.

Ultimately, **the synergy between GMs and NNs** enables systems that are both expressive and interpretable.
