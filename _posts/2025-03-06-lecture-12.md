## Partially-Observed Graphical Models

### Mixture Models
- A density model $p(x)$ may be multi-modal.
- Can we model it as a mixture of uni-modal distributions?

### Unobserved Variables
- A variable can be unobserved (latent) because:
  - It is difficult or impossible to measure (e.g., causes of a disease, evolutionary ancestors).
  - It is only sometimes measured (e.g., faulty sensors).
  - It is an imaginary quantity meant to provide a simplified but useful view of the data generation process (e.g., mixture assignments).
- Discrete latent variables can be used for cluster assignments.
- Continuous latent variables can be used for dimensionality reduction.

### Challenges in Learning with Latent Variables
- In fully observed IID settings, the log-likelihood decomposes into a sum of local terms:
  
  $$
  \ell_c(\theta;D) = \log p(x,z \mid \theta) = \log p(z \mid \theta_z) + \log p(x \mid z,\theta_x)
  $$
  
- With latent variables, all parameters become coupled via marginalization:
  
  $$
  \ell_c(\theta;D) = \log \sum_{z} p(x,z \mid \theta) = \log \sum_{z} p(z \mid \theta_z) p(x \mid z, \theta_x)
  $$
  
  - Sum over $z$ is inside the log.

**Strategy:**
1. Guess value of $Z$.
2. Apply Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate best model parameters based on $Z$.
3. Infer most likely $Z$ based on MLE parameter estimates.
4. Return to step 2 until $Z$ stops changing.

## Expectation-Maximization (EM)

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

![Gaussian Mixture Models](image3.png)

- Consider a mixture of $K$ Gaussian components:
  - This model can be used for unsupervised clustering.
  - $Z$ is a latent class indicator:
    
    $$
    p(z_n) = \text{multi}(z_n : \pi) = \prod_k (\pi_k)^{z_n^k}
    $$
    
  - $X$ is a conditional Gaussian variable with a class-specific mean and covariance:
    
    $$
    p(x_n \mid z_n^k = 1, \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{m/2} |\Sigma_k|^{1/2}}
    \exp \left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (x_n - \mu_k)^T \Sigma_k^{-1} (x_n - \mu_k) \right\}
    $$
    
  - Likelihood:
    
    $$
    p(x_n \mid \mu, \Sigma) = \sum_k \pi_k N(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
    $$

### EM for GMMs

**Algorithm:**
1. **Start:**
   - Guess the value of centroids $\mu_k$ and covariances $\Sigma_k$ of each of the $K$ clusters.
   - Loop:
2. **E-Step:** Compute the expected value of the sufficient statistics of the hidden variables under current estimates of parameters:
   
   $$
   \tau_n^{k(t)} = p\left(z_n^k = 1 \mid x, \mu^{(t)}, \Sigma^{(t)}\right) =
   \frac{\pi_k^{(t)} N(x_n \mid \mu_k^{(t)}, \Sigma_k^{(t)})}{\sum_i \pi_i^{(t)} N(x_n \mid \mu_i^{(t)}, \Sigma_i^{(t)})}
   $$
   
3. **M-Step:** Using the current expected value of the hidden variables, compute the parameters that maximize the likelihood:
   
   $$
   \mu_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_n \tau_n^{k(t)} x_n}{\sum_n \tau_n^{k(t)}}
   $$
   
   $$
   \Sigma_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_n \tau_n^{k(t)} (x_n - \mu_k^{(t+1)})(x_n - \mu_k^{(t+1)})^T}{\sum_n \tau_n^{k(t)}}
   $$

## K-Means vs. EM

- K-means clustering is the hard-assignment version of EM for mixture of Gaussians:
  - **K-Means E-Step:**
    
    $$
    z_n^{(t)} = \arg\max_k (x_n - \mu_k^{(t)})^T \Sigma_k^{(t)^{-1}} (x_n - \mu_k^{(t)})
    $$
    
  - **K-Means M-Step:**
    
    $$
    \mu_k^{(t+1)} = \frac{\sum_n \delta(z_n^{(t)}, k) x_n}{\sum_n \delta(z_n^{(t)}, k)}
    $$

## Why Does EM Work?

- The expected complete log-likelihood is a lower bound on the log-likelihood:
  
  $$
  \ell(\theta; x) \geq \langle \ell_c(\theta; x, z) \rangle_q + H_q
  $$

- EM Algorithm at Convergence:
  
  $$
  \theta_{t+1} = \arg\max_{\theta} Q(\theta', \theta_t)
  $$

## Foreshadowing Variational Inference

- **EM:** Let $q_t(z \mid x) = p(z \mid x, \theta_t)$. Maximize $p(x \mid \theta)$ by iterating:
  
  $$
  \theta_{t+1} = \arg\max_{\theta} Q(\theta', \theta_t)
  $$

- **Variational Inference:**
  - Let $q(z \mid x)$ be some family that is easier to optimize:
    
    $$
    \log p(x \mid \theta) \geq \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q}[\log p(x, z \mid \theta)] + H(q)
    $$
    
  - **ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound):**
    
    $$
    \text{ELBO} = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q}[\log p(x, z \mid \theta)] + H(q)
    $$
