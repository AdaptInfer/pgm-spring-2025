# From Transformer to GPT

## The Original Transformer

The original Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) was designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks and uses an  framework.


  - : Maps an input sequence to a contextualized representation.
  - : Produces outputs token-by-token using the encoder output and previously generated tokens.
  - : Mechanism for learning dependencies within a sequence.
  - : Fully relies on self-attention in both encoder and decoder for translation tasks.



$$
P(Y  X) = _t P(Y_t  Y_{<t}, X)
$$

## Evolving to a GPT

GPT simplifies the Transformer by dropping the encoder and using a decoder-only model to model input sequences:

$$
P(X) = _t P(X_t  X_{<t})
$$


$$
_{} _i _t  P_(X_{i,t}  X_{i,<t})
$$

This enforces causal structure over the input, forming a directed probabilistic graphical model.

# Writing a GPT

## Model Configuration

```python
import torch
torch.manual_seed(1337)

# Training hyperparameters
batch_size = 16
max_iters = 5000
eval_interval = 100
learning_rate = 1e-3
eval_iters = 200

# Model hyperparameters
from gpt_config import GPTConfig
config = GPTConfig(
    block_size = 8,
    device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu',
    n_embd = 64,
    n_head = 4,
    n_layer = 4,
    dropout = 0.0
)
```

## Load and Encode Dataset

```python
with open('input.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read()
chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
config.vocab_size = len(chars)

stoi = { ch:i for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
itos = { i:ch for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
encode = lambda s: [stoi[c] for c in s]
decode = lambda l: ''.join([itos[i] for i in l])
```

## Train/Test Split and Block Sampling

```python
data = torch.tensor(encode(text), dtype=torch.long)
n = int(0.9*len(data))
train_data = data[:n]
val_data = data[n:]

x = train_data[:config.block_size]
y = train_data[1:config.block_size+1]
for t in range(config.block_size):
    context = x[:t+1]
    target = y[t]
    print(f"For input {context}, target is: {target}")
```

## Helper Functions

```python
def get_batch(split):
    data = train_data if split == 'train' else val_data
    ix = torch.randint(len(data) - config.block_size, (batch_size,))
    x = torch.stack([data[i:i+config.block_size] for i in ix])
    y = torch.stack([data[i+1:i+config.block_size+1] for i in ix])
    return x.to(config.device), y.to(config.device)

@torch.no_grad()
def estimate_loss():
    out = {}
    model.eval()
    for split in ['train', 'val']:
        losses = torch.zeros(eval_iters)
        for k in range(eval_iters):
            X, Y = get_batch(split)
            logits, loss = model(X, Y)
            losses[k] = loss.item()
        out[split] = losses.mean()
    model.train()
    return out
```

## Training the Model

```python
from gpt_zero import GPT
model = GPT(config)
m = model.to(config.device)
print(sum(p.numel() for p in m.parameters())/1e6, 'M parameters')

optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

for iter in range(max_iters):
    if iter % eval_interval == 0 or iter == max_iters - 1:
        losses = estimate_loss()
        print(f"step {iter}: train loss {losses['train']:.4f}, val loss {losses['val']:.4f}")

    xb, yb = get_batch('train')
    logits, loss = model(xb, yb)
    optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=config.device)
print(decode(m.generate(context, max_new_tokens=2000)[0].tolist()))
```

# Scaling from “GPT” to GPT-4

## Overview

This section summarizes the evolution of the GPT family, from a simple, scratch-built model to GPT-4. Each stage reflects major increases in model size, dataset quality, training techniques, and inference strategies. As the architecture scaled, so did the model’s capabilities—enabling GPT to move from character-level toy outputs to world-class language generation and multimodal reasoning.

## Glossary of Key Terms

  -  Breaks input text into smaller units. GPT evolved from character-level to Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), and later to multimodal tokenization.
  -  Activation functions that determine how neurons in the model fire. GELU is smoother and generally performs better in transformers.
  -  Size of the vector used to represent each token.
  -  Parallel attention mechanisms in each transformer block that allow the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
  -  Maximum number of tokens the model can consider at once.
  -  Total number of learnable weights in the model. Higher parameter counts generally allow for more expressive power.
  -  Text corpus used to train the model. Increased in size and diversity across versions.
  -  Algorithm used to adjust the model weights during training. Adam is widely used, often with modifications like learning rate warmup and weight decay.
  -  Method for generating output text. Greedy selects the highest-probability token each time, while top-$k$ introduces diversity.
  -  A sparsely activated architecture where only subsets of the model are used per input, improving scalability.
  -  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback—a training method that aligns model outputs with human preferences.

    -  $$13 trillion tokens ($$50TB)
    -  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) + system-level safety mechanisms
  


## Mixture of Experts (MoE)

 Instead of using a single feedforward layer (FFN) at each transformer block, MoE introduces multiple ``expert'' FFNs and uses a routing mechanism to dynamically select a subset for each input.



  - A  analyzes each input token and assigns it to the most relevant expert(s).
  - Only a small subset of experts (e.g., 1 or 2 out of 4) is activated per token.
  - This allows for , reducing the cost while increasing model capacity.

  - In a standard transformer (left), each token passes through a single FFN after self-attention.
  - In an MoE transformer (right), this FFN is replaced with  (the experts).
  - The router selects a few experts to process the token, and the outputs are combined.
  - Result: Higher model capacity with the same or lower computational cost at inference time.

## Mixture of Experts: Probabilistic View

 Model the output as a weighted sum of predictions from multiple expert networks.


  - Let
  $$
  P(Y  X) = _{m} g_m(X)  P_m(Y  X)
  $$
  where:
  
    - \( P_m(Y  X) \): prediction from expert \( m \)
    - \( g_m(X) \): gating function output (i.e., weight) for expert \( m \)
  

  - Subject to constraints:
  $$
  _m g_m(X) = 1,    g_m(X)  0   m, X
  $$
  ensuring a valid probability distribution over experts.
  
  - A  computes \( g_m(X) \), deciding how much each expert contributes based on the input.
  - The  uses these weights to sample or activate experts probabilistically.

  - This framework can be trained via the , where:
  
    - E-step estimates expert responsibilities \( g_m(X) \)
    - M-step updates expert and gating parameters
  


## MoE: A Unifying Framework for Ensembles

Let the predictive distribution be modeled as:
$$
P(Y  X) = _{m} g_m(X)  P_m(Y  X)
$$


  -  $g_m(X)$ is a .
  -  $g_m(X) = {M}$ is a  across experts.
  -  $g_m(X) = _m$ is a , constant across inputs.


## MoE: Error Analysis

Let:
$$
P(Y  X) = _{m} g_m(X)  P_m(Y  X)
$$

Define the expected prediction (mean function) of the ensemble:
$$
(x) := [Y  X = x] = _{m} g_m(x) f_m(x)
$$

Compare two types of errors:

  - 
  $$
  (x) := (Y - (x))^2
  $$
  - 
  $$
  (x) := {M} _m (Y - f_m(x))^2
  $$


 Will minimizing ensemble error $(x)$ also minimize average expert error $(x)$?

## MoE: Diversity vs. Error



  - Ensemble error: \((x) = (Y - (x))^2\)
  - Average expert error: \((x) = {M} _m (Y - f_m(x))^2\)




  - As  increases (x-axis = \% unique training data per expert):
    
      - \((x)\) (solid line): Ensemble error is minimized at moderate diversity.
      - \((x)\) (dotted line): Average expert error increases with diversity.
      - Dashed line: Represents disagreement (variance) between experts' outputs.
    


[H]
    
    ![image](assets/img/notes/lecture-20/three_lines.png)




  - Expert predictions can individually overfit, but if their errors are uncorrelated, the ensemble prediction can be robust and accurate.
  -  Diverse (even slightly overfitted) experts cancel out each other's errors when averaged.
  -  or purposeful variation among experts improves ensemble generalization.


## MoE in Large Language Models (LLMs)



  - Input \(  \) is passed through a , which outputs activations \( (x) \).
  - The router computes  \( G(x) \), representing how much to weight each expert.
  - A small number of experts (e.g., top-1 or top-2) are activated based on \( G(x) \).
  - Only the selected FFNNs are evaluated; their outputs \( E(x) \) are weighted by \( G(x) \) and aggregated into the final output \( y \).


[H]
    
    ![image](assets/img/notes/lecture-20/gpt_process.png)




  -  Sparse activation means only a few experts need to be loaded and executed per token, reducing compute and memory.
  -  Enables use of massive models without needing to evaluate all parameters at once.




  -  Without proper regularization, some experts dominate while others are underused.
  -  As shown in the plot, more experts (e.g., 128) can reduce training loss but may hurt validation performance due to overfitting or imbalance.




  - Validation loss increases for larger expert counts, indicating a generalization gap.
  - Solution approaches may include load balancing, expert dropout, or routing noise.
